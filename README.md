# tat-wow-queries-backup

TAT-WOW (Turn Around Times and Ways of Working) was a SeqOps project that ran in Autumn 2022. It aimed to analyse the turnaround times between different milestones in the journey of a sample through SeqOps, in order to look for bottlenecks and areas for improvement. It was led by an external Lean consultant and involved a cross-functional team, including two members of PSD. We were responsible for writing queries to access the timestamp data. We aimed to mostly use data from the Events Warehouse, but also used a variety of other data sources, including Sequencescape and LabWhere. The project was run pipeline by pipeline, and the folder structure reflects that.

This is an archive of the queries we used, in case it's useful for future reporting work.
